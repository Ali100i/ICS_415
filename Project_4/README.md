# Interactive Bézier Curve Editor - Project 4

This project is a visual editor built with React that allows you to interactively create and manipulate Bézier curves. Users can add control points by clicking on a canvas and dynamically visualize cubic and poly Bézier segments in real time.

## Features

- **Click-to-Add Points:** Add control points by clicking anywhere on the canvas.
- **Supports Poly Bézier Curves:** Every group of 4 points creates a new Bézier segment.
- **Live Curve Rendering:** Automatically redraws curves as you add or remove points.
- **High-Resolution Canvas:** Crisp rendering using device pixel ratio scaling.
- **Custom UI Styling:** A distinct modern theme for UI buttons and layout.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 18 or later is recommended.
- **Basic Knowledge:** Familiarity with React and browser-based canvas rendering is helpful.
