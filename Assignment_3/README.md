# Light Reflections - Assignment 3

This repository contains a simple implementation of a ray tracing algorithm in Python. The program generates a 3D-rendered scene with spheres, a cylinder, and a Stanford Rabbit (loaded from an OBJ file) with specular reflections, then saves the output as an image.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pillow

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali100i/ICS_415.git
   cd ICS_415/Assignment_3
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python Light_reflections.py
   ```

3. After running, the script will generate an image file named `raytraced_scene.png` in the same directory.

## Customization

You can modify the scene by editing the objects and lights defined in the `render_scene` function within the `Light_reflections.py` file.

### Spheres

Each sphere is defined by:
- **Center**: The position of the sphere in 3D space.
- **Radius**: The size of the sphere.
- **Color**: The RGB color of the sphere.
- **Specular**: The specular coefficient (shininess).
- **Reflective**: The reflection coefficient (a value between 0 and 1).

Example:
```python
spheres = [
    Sphere(Vector3(0, -1, 3), 1, (255, 0, 0), 500, 0.09),  # Red sphere
    Sphere(Vector3(2, 0, 4), 1, (0, 0, 255), 500, 0.2),     # Blue sphere
    Sphere(Vector3(-2, 0, 4), 1, (0, 255, 0), 10, 0.2),     # Green sphere
    Sphere(Vector3(0, -5001, 0), 5000, (255, 255, 0), 1000, 0)  # Yellow sphere (ground)
]
```

### Lights

Lights are defined by:
- **type**: `ambient`, `point`, or `directional`.
- **intensity**: A float value specifying the light's intensity.
- **position**: The position of the light (for point lights).
- **direction**: The direction of the light (for directional lights).

Example:
```python
lights = [
    Light("ambient", 0.2),
    Light("point", 0.6, position=Vector3(2, 1, 0)),
    Light("directional", 0.2, direction=Vector3(1, 4, 4))
]
```

## Output

The program renders a scene that includes spheres, a cylinder, and the Stanford Rabbit, then saves the final image as `raytraced_scene.png`.
