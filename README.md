# ICS 415 - Computer Graphics

Welcome to the **ICS 415** repository! This repository contains assignments and in-class challenges related to **computer graphics and ray tracing**.

## Repository Structure

This repository is divided into multiple sections based on assignments and challenges:

### ðŸ“‚ Assignments
1. **[Assignment 1](Assignment_1/)** - *Ray Meets Sphere*
2. **[Assignment 2](Assignment_2/)** - *Specular Reflection*
3. **[Assignment 3](Assignment_3/)** - *Shadows and Reflections*
